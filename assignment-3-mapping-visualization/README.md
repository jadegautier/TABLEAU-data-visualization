## Assignment 3 – Mapping & Geographic Visualization in Tableau

**Course Context**  
Graduate-level Data Visualization course, Columbia University.

### Objective
Visualize changes in **child poverty rates across U.S. states and territories** over time, using both traditional and alternative geographic representations.

### Dataset
- Children in Poverty in the U.S. dataset (Kids Count Data Center)
- Time periods analyzed:
  - 2007
  - 2012
  - 2017
  - 2022
- Supplemental hex map dataset for alternative spatial encoding

### Visualizations Built
Two Tableau dashboards were created:

1. **Choropleth Map**
   - Displays child poverty rates by state
   - Enables comparison across years

2. **Hex Map**
   - Represents states using equal-sized hexagons
   - Reduces geographic size bias
   - Highlights relative differences more clearly

### Key Insights
- Child poverty rates vary significantly by region  
- Some states show consistent improvement over time, while others remain persistently high  
- Hex maps can reveal patterns that are less obvious in traditional choropleth maps  

### Technical Considerations
- Established relationships between state names and abbreviations  
- Managed multiple datasets within Tableau  
- Applied consistent color scales across years  

### Tools
- Tableau  
- Geospatial visualization techniques  

**Note:**  
Dashboards were developed in Tableau Desktop and submitted as packaged workbooks (`.twbx`).  
Interactive maps are not embedded here due to Tableau Public access limitations.
