# Assignment 1 – Data & Chart Types (Tableau)

## Context
This project was completed as part of a graduate-level data visualization course at **Columbia University (SPS)**.

## Objective
Explore how different chart types can be used to effectively communicate insights from company-level data using Tableau.

## Dataset
Company dataset (`companies.csv`) including:
- Company name
- Revenue
- Number of employees
- Founding year

## Visualizations Built
The following visualizations were created in separate Tableau sheets:

1. Sorted bar chart of companies by number of employees  
2. Bubble chart showing companies by revenue  
3. Two pie charts:
   - Revenue distribution
   - Employee distribution  
4. Two circle views of companies with fewer than 400,000 employees:
   - Ordered by founding year
   - Separate views for revenue and employee count  

## Key Insights
- Company size does not scale linearly with revenue  
- Filtering improves interpretability in dense datasets  
- Chart selection significantly impacts insight clarity  

## Tools
- Tableau
- Data visualization principles

## Notes
Dashboards were built in Tableau Desktop and submitted as a packaged workbook (`.twbx`).  
Interactive dashboards are not embedded here due to Tableau Public access limitations.
